## Configuration
You can access your client id, client secret and api key from the Investec Developer Portal.
More information on how to access your keys can be found on the [Investec Developer Community Wiki](https://investec.gitbook.io/programmable-banking-community-wiki/get-started/api-quick-start-guide/how-to-get-your-api-keys).

To configure the CLI, run the following command:
```bash
npx ipb config --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> --card-id <card-id>
```
The card id is optional and can be set when calling each command. If you specify a card when calling a command, it will override the card id set in the configuration.

## Usage
To run the code locally, run the following command:
```sh
npx ipb run -f main.js --env prod --amount 60000 --currency ZAR --mcc 0000 --merchant "Test Merchant" --city "Test City" --country ZA
```

To upload code you will need a card key this can be retireved by calling the following command:
```sh
npx ipb cards
```

To upload code to the card, run the following command by setting the card key, the file and the env to upload:
The env is optional and needs the file to be .env.prod if you specify prod

```sh
npx ipb deploy -c <cardkey> -f main.js --env prod
```

You can get your card execution logs with the following command
```sh
npx ipb logs -f <filename> -c <cardkey>
```
